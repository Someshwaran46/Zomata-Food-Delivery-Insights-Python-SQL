# Zomata - Food Delivery Data Insights Using Python and SQL

This project focuses on analyzing food delivery data to enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. Using SQL, Python, and Streamlit, we develop an interactive tool for managing orders, customers, restaurants, and deliveries. The tool supports dynamic schema changes and robust database operations. By generating synthetic datasets with Python's Faker library, we build a relational database with normalized tables. Key use cases include order management, customer analytics, delivery optimization, and restaurant insights. The project emphasizes object-oriented programming (OOP) principles for modular, scalable code. SQL queries extract valuable insights, which are visualized in a user-friendly Streamlit app. Learners will gain practical experience in data engineering, database management, and data analysis. This project helps businesses optimize delivery operations and improve customer experience.
